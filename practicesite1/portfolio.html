 	<h3> <i> How-To Video Project  </i> </h3>
 	
 	<p> The How-To video project required creating a video that instructs an audience 
 	 on a subject that is relevant within an academic or professional environment.
 	 For my video, I provide instructions for George Mason students on how to create 
 	 an email signature within their MasonLive Outlook email. </p>
 	
 	<p> Through completing this project,it enabled me to use the many skills I've acquired 
 	 over the years, including my video editing and video creation abilities, as well as my ability to create simple
 	 graphics. Additionally, the video exhibits the time I took to learn about the
 	 how-to genre and my understanding of rhetoric. These two skills allowed me to 
 	 create an informative and thorough guide to persuade audiences to follow my 
 	 instruction, as well as sell Outlook as a product that is worth exploring and 
 	 learning more about its other tools.</p>

	 <h3>  <i> White Paper & Infographic Project  </i>  </h3>
	 
	<p>In my paper, I focus on persuading health experts and scientists on Youtube to use 
 	the communication tactics I outline when encouraging the public to follow COVID safety
 	guidelines and have their videos better reach and resonate with audiences during the 
 	pandemic. </p>
 	
 	<p> Creating this document required <em> extensive research</em>, as well as knowledge of 
 	the genres of the white paper and infographic, through spending time learning about each
 	genre. Additionally, this project allowed me to express the understanding I've gained
 	through personal research on how to successfully communicate on social media and my 
 	ability to write rhetorically as an English student concentrating in writing and 
 	rhetoric.</p>

	 <h3> <i> Calvert County: Past & Present Agriculture Podcast  </i></h3>
	 
	 <p> The final presentation for the project required creating a 5-minute podcast that 
	 reflects on the content of the 1-hour interview on agriculture in Calvert County.
	 More specifically, the audio introduces the subject of the interview, Susie Hance-Wells,
	 and conveys the important sentiments she emphasized on the current policies and restrictions
	 on those in the agricultural field and the importance of supporting those in the occupation. 
	 Creating the podcast required learning how to use the program Audicity as well as using
	 what I learned in ENGH 412 to best represent the voice of my interviewee. </p>
