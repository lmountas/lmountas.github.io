	<article >
	<p > My name is Lamia Mountassir and I am currently a student at George Mason
	University studying English with a concentration in writing &amp; rhetoric.<br> 
	By following this path, I have learned to write and create material for various 
	audiences and situations. For example, I have written and done <br> research to 
 	create content such as how-to videos and white papers. More specifically, I created a <a href="portfolio.html#howto">how-to video</a> 
 	on how Mason students can create <br> an email signature as well as a <a href="portfolio.html#whitepaper">white paper</a> on how health experts and scientists
 	on Youtube can address concerns regarding COVID to the public.</p>
 	
 
 	<p> During the Spring 2021 semester, I have had the opportunity to work on a 
 	collaboration project between GMU and Calvert&nbsp;County,&nbsp;MD, 
 	called <br> <i> Calvert&nbsp;County:&nbsp;Agriculture&nbsp;Past&nbsp;and&nbsp;Present. </i>Throughout 
 	this project, I had the opportunity to engage with a farmer about the rural community,<br> 
 	her experiences as a woman in agriculture, and environmental policies. Furthermore, I
 	also learned how to interview and conducted a <br> <em> 1-hour phone interview </em> 
 	as well as created a transcript, <a href="portfolio.html#pod">podcast</a>, and log to supplement the interview.
 	Before I graduate in December of 2021, <br> I'm  currently seeking to begin gaining 
 	work experience through opportunities in writing professionally 
 	within editorial, journalism, <br> and digital media internships.</p>
